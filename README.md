# generator-sf 

> Yeoman generator to scaffold Symfony PHP apps with full featured frontend tooling incl. browsersync

### Work in Progress
This generqator should replace [`generator-grunt-symfony`](https://github.com/bezoerb/generator-grunt-symfony) when it's done.
The new name should allow more task runner flexibility (e.g. gulp) 

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-sf using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-sf
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo sf
```
